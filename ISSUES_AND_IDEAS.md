## AI Ideas

*Note: These ideas need human approval before implementation*

1. **Visual damage preview**
   - Show damage numbers on hover/tap for unrevealed tiles based on current party immunities
   - Could use color coding (green = safe, yellow = some damage, red = high damage)

2. **Mini-map**
   - Small overview map showing explored area and player position
   - Could be toggleable or always visible in corner

3. **Move history / undo**
   - Allow undoing last move (maybe limited to 1-3 undos)
   - Could help with learning and reduce frustration from accidental moves

4. **Difficulty settings**
   - Easy: More starting health, easier king requirements
   - Hard: Less health, stricter rules
   - Could make game accessible to more players

5. **Statistics tracking**
   - Track games played, wins, losses, average moves, etc.
   - Could store in localStorage and show in a stats screen

6. **Sound effects**
   - Add subtle sound effects for moves, card reveals, damage, victory
   - Could enhance immersion without being distracting

7. **Accessibility improvements**
   - Keyboard navigation for all UI elements
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast mode
   - Colorblind-friendly color schemes

8. **Save/load game state**
   - Allow saving current game state to localStorage
   - Resume later from saved state
   - Could help with longer play sessions

9. **Tutorial mode**
   - Interactive tutorial explaining game mechanics
   - Step-by-step guidance for first-time players

10. **Replay system**
    - Record game moves and allow replaying
    - Could help with debugging and sharing interesting games
