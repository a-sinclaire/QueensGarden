---

## Setup

### Deck Preparation
- Remove all 2s, 3s, and 4s from a standard deck of playing cards
- Remove only your chosen starting Queen from the deck (see Choosing Your Queen below)
- Shuffle the remaining deck

### Choosing Your Queen
- Choose one of the four Queens to play as: Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, or Hearts
- Your chosen Queen determines your starting suit
- **Important**: Only your starting Queen is removed from the deck - it is separate and will be placed in your Party area
- The other three Queens remain in the deck and must be discovered in the Queen's Garden

### Components
- **d20 (Twenty-Sided Die)**: Typically used for two purposes:
  - **Health Counter**: Set the d20 to 20 to track your current health
  - **Location Token**: Place the d20 on the card representing your current location on the board
  - Adjust the d20's face value as your health changes, and move it to track your position

### Party Area
- Set up a separate area on the table designated as your "Party"
- Your starting Queen is placed face-up in your Party area
- All Queens you collect during the game are placed in your Party area
- **Immunity**: You gain immunity to damage from tiles matching the suit of any Queen currently in your Party
  - This includes your starting Queen
  - Example: If you have the Queen of Hearts in your Party, you take no damage from Heart suit tiles

### Starting Conditions
- **Health**: Start with 20 health (set your d20 to 20)
- **Starting Position**: Your Queen begins in the central chamber (place your d20 on the central chamber card)
- **Initial Reveal**: The four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) from the central chamber are revealed by drawing cards from the top of the deck

## Basic Gameplay

### Movement
- The Queen can move to adjacent tiles (orthogonally adjacent)
- Movement is one tile per turn
- Move your d20 token to the new tile when you move

### Tile Interactions
- **Party Immunity**: You are immune to damage from tiles matching the suit of any Queen currently in your Party
  - This means tiles of those suits are safe and deal no damage
- **Other Suit Tiles**: Tiles of suits not represented in your Party deal damage equal to the number on the card when you move onto them
  - Number cards (5-9): Deal damage equal to their face value
  - Face cards have special rules (see Special Cards section)
  - When you take damage, reduce your health and adjust your d20 accordingly

## Special Cards

### Aces (Teleporters)
- Aces function as teleporters
- You can teleport from one Ace to any other Ace on the board, or back to the central chamber
- **Same Suit**: Using an Ace of your suit is free
- **Different Suit**: Using an Ace of a different suit deals 1 damage (Aces are worth 1)

### Jacks (Traps)
- Jacks cannot be stepped on or passed through
- **Adjacent Damage**: If you move adjacent to a Jack of a suit not represented in your Party, you take 4 damage
- This damage applies when the Jack is revealed, even if you don't step on it
- **Party Immunity**: You are immune to Jacks of suits matching any Queen in your Party (see Queens section)

### Queens (Collectibles)
- **In the Deck**: Three Queens remain in the deck (the three you did not choose as your starting Queen)
- These Queens must be discovered and collected as you explore the Queen's Garden
- **Party Limit**: You can have up to 3 Queens total in your Party (including your starting Queen)
- **Collecting Queens**: When you move onto a Queen tile, add it to your Party area
- **Party Immunities**: Each Queen in your Party grants you immunity to damage from tiles of that Queen's suit
  - This immunity is active as long as the Queen remains in your Party
  - You gain immunities from all Queens currently in your Party simultaneously
  - Example: If your Party contains the Queen of Hearts and Queen of Spades, you are immune to damage from both Heart and Spade suit tiles

### Kings (Victory Condition & Abilities)
- **In the Deck**: All four Kings are in the deck and must be discovered as you explore the Queen's Garden
- **Victory Condition**: The goal is to collect all 4 Kings
- **Collection Requirement**: To collect a King, you must have the Queen of the same color but different suit in your Party
  - Example: To collect the King of Diamonds, you need the Queen of Hearts in your Party (both red suits)
- **Collection Cost**: When you collect a King, remove the Queen used to collect it from your Party (you lose that Queen's immunity)
- **Final King Rule**: You must collect the King corresponding to your starting Queen last
  - Example: If you started as the Queen of Hearts, you must collect the King of Diamonds last
- **King Ability**: Each owned King can be spent once to destroy/remove any adjacent tile
  - This ability can only be used once per King
  - After using this ability, the King is still owned but cannot destroy tiles again

### 10s (Walls)
- 10s act as walls and cannot be passed through
- Walls can be destroyed using a King's ability (see Kings section)

---

## Win Condition

Collect all 4 Kings, ensuring that the King corresponding to your starting Queen is collected last.
